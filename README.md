# Basic Redis Chat App Demo Python (Flask)

Showcases how to impliment chat app in Python (Flask), Socket.IO and Redis. This example uses **pub/sub** feature combined with web-sockets for implementing the message communication between client and server.

I have implemented a DevOps journey using Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD pipelines to ensure a scalable and reliable deployment of the chat application.

You can check out my blog for a detailed explanation of the DevOps journey and the implementation of the chat application. It is broken down in parts:

- [Part 1: Running the Chat Application Manually](https://wegoagain00.vercel.app/posts/python-chat-app-part-1)
- [Part 2: Containerising the Chat Application using Docker](https://wegoagain00.vercel.app/posts/python-chat-app-part-2)
- [Part 3: Implementing CI using GitHub Actions and pushing to AWS ECR](pending)
- [Part 4: Deploying to Kubernetes with Terraform and EKS](pending)
